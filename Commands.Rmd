#Getting started with NFL data and R
Start by loading the nflfastR package and library, and tidyverse. You only have to do this once.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("nflfastR")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
##Load libraries
R makes "packages" of commands that are useful for different kinds of data analysis.  In order to use those commands, you load the libraries of commands *each time* you run your project.

```{r libraries}
library(nflfastR)
library(tidyverse)
```

##Load data
NflfastR allows us to download all the plays from various seasons. Let's get all the plays from the 2021-22 season, into a dataframe called pbp22

```{r data}
pbp22 <- load_pbp(2021) 
```
###What did we just do?
We used the command load_pbp() to specify we wanted the play-by-play data from 2021 (the 21-22 season is specified by the starting year)./


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
